RaisedCenterButton
==================

An example project to demonstrate how simple it is to implement a raised center button. Inspired by previous releases of Instagram and Path.

Previous examples show how you would implement it subclassing UITabBarController. This example takes a simplier approach and just layers a uibutton subclass on top of the tabbar.
